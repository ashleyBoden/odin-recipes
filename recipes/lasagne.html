    <p>
      One day, not having any gluten-free pasta on hand but lots of zucchini, I
      decided to use 'zoodles' instead of noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole family enjoyed it! I don't use any salt in the recipe because
      the cheeses already contain it. This dish is even better the next day and
      freezes well too.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 zucchini</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups homemade or store-bought tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups bechamel sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmigiano reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices with a knife or
        mandolin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 2 tablespoons tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking
        dish. Arrange zucchini slices in a single layer, slightly overlapping,
        over tomato sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with a thin layer of mozzarella, 1/3 of the bechamel (see Editor's
        Note), 1/3 of remaining tomato sauce, 1/3 of the Parmigiano Reggiano
        cheese, and 1/3 of the basil. Repeat layers, topping with bechamel and
        Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden
        brown, about 35 minutes. Allow to set until remaining liquid is
        absorbed, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
    </ul>
